#Basic Rules

  A player may play a Power card as one of their actions by declaring which card they are using and flipping it face down, marking it as "spent." The card will remain "spent" until the end of their *next* turn, at which time the player may flip it face up again.
 
  However, most cards can only be used in certain situations, so a card can only be played if the card-specific conditions are met. See the next section, "Power Cards" for details.

  A. Line of sight
  
  Certain ranged Power cards such as Fireball and Shock require you to have "line of sight" with another player. There are two forms of "line of sight" -- flat-line (ex: Fireball), and diagonal-line (ex: Shock). 
  
  Flat-line of sight means you can draw a straight line between yourself and the target dragon, crossing through the flat sides of the hexagon tiles, without any mountains or other dragons in between you:

  Diagonal-line of sight means you can draw a straight line between yourself and the target dragon, crossing through the diagonal corners of the hexagon tiles, without any mountains or other dragons in between you:

  Any mountains in the between you and the target will block line of sight. You will still be able to target a dragon standing *on* a mountain in your line of sight, but not one *behind* it.

  Water tiles confer immunity to line-of-sight powers, but do not block line-of-sight powers the way mountains do. (The dragon on that tile is hiding underneath the water and any attack would fly straight over them). Dragons standing on a water tile are still able to use line-of-sight powers themselves, however (they duck their heads above water to attack).
  
  B. Reaction powers
  
  Some cards (Poison, Rubber Ducky) can only be used in reaction to other powers. When a card is used against you that triggers one of your reaction powers, at that moment you *may elect* to immediately use your reaction power in response, but you do not have to. Two conditions must be met: 1) the reaction must be legal (see the card's rules), and 2) the reaction card must not be spent (it must be face-up). A reaction card used in this way remains "spent" until the end of your *next* turn. 
  
  Example 1: Megan is player 1 in a six player game and completes her turn. John, player 2, hits her with a fireball. Megan plays her Shield in response, canceling the fireball's effects, marking the Shield as "spent." The Shield will not be available until players 3-6 have taken their turns, *and* Megan finishes her *next* turn after that. Until then her Shield cannot protect her.
  
  Example 2: Emily is player 4 in a four player game and it is Lars's turn (he's player 3). He hits her with a freeze spell, and she uses her Amulet in response, canceling the freeze, marking the Amulet as "spent." The Amulet will not be available until Emily finishes her *next* turn which is... really soon! Lars ends his turn and now it's Emily's turn. She takes some actions, ends her turn, and flips her Amulet back over, fully charged and ready to go.

7. Wearing The Pants

 Whenever a player currently holding The Pants ends their turn, they draw a card from the Deck of Destiny and reveal it face up in a discard pile next to the Deck of Destiny. They then move the time status token a corresponding number of spaces. Example: Sean begins his turn with the time status token on "0." He ends his turn wearing the pants, and draws a Destiny card. It's "-1", so he moves the time status token to "-1". Next turn, Lars steals the pants and draws a "-2", he moves the time status token to "-3". On the next three turns, nobody steals the pants, so no Destiny card is drawn. Now it's Sean's turn again, he steals the pants back from Lars, and draws a "+1", moving the time status token to "-2".
 
 The game ends when the time status token reaches the time target token. Players can double check by simply summing up all the discarded Destiny cards. If the Deck of Destiny has been properly arranged, the game should be guaranteed to end when all the cards have been drawn, but because of the random ordering the game could always end early, so you never know exactly how much time is left. When the game ends, whichever player is currently wearing the pants is declared the winner.
 
 Remember, Destiny cards are only drawn when a player wearing The Pants ends their turn! It is not possible for the game to end without someone wearing The Pants.
 
 **SPECIAL RULE:** If the player wearing The Pants is currently occupying a Den tile, then they *do not* draw a Destiny card at the end of their turn.
