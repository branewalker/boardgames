#Dragon Pants

*Alternatively, "Dragon Trousers" in the U.K. and Europe*

Designed by Megan Bednarz and Lars Doucet

##Overview

2-6 players  
Playtime: ~30 minutes  
Suggested age: 10+ maybe?

##Summary

Players take turns moving their dragons across the board, taking advantage of terrain tiles, and drawing and using power cards, all in the hopes of controlling a legendary artifact of ultimate power: a handsomely tailored and comfortably stylish pair of denim work jeans known as *The Pants*. The Pants can only be worn by one dragon at a time, but control is fleeting as it's only a matter of time until another dragon pries The Pants loose from their owner's claws. Time ticks down one card at a time whenever a dragon wearing The Pants ends their turn. The game concludes when the timer runs out, and whichever dragon happens to be wearing The Pants at that moment wins.

##Setup

1. Arrange the hexagonal tiles like this:

  ![Dragon Pants board](/dragon_pants/images/map_small.png)
  
  NOTE: This game was originally prototyped by using hexagonal tiles from other games I had lying around, such as *The Settlers of Catan.* If you have such a game you can just repurposes existing hexagonal tiles to play *Dragon Pants.*

2. Set up the "Deck of Destiny"

  Place all "time" cards (those bearing a number with a + or - sign) into their own deck. This is the "Deck of Destiny." Select a set of time cards to include in this deck (see table below), shuffle them together, and place the deck face-down next to the board. Place all unused time cards back in the game box -- they will not be used.
  
   Place the time card on the table and place the time status marker at 0, and the time target marker on your chosen time goal. (If this is your first time playing, we recommend the "Standard game" deck and a time goal of **-10**).
  
  ###Standard game
  
 | Card type |   -1  |    -2 |    -3 |    +1 |    +2 | Deck sum |
 | --------  | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :------: |
 | # in deck |   13  |     1 |     0 |     3 |     1 |   -10    |
 
  ###Volatile game
  
 | Card type |   -1  |    -2 |    -3 |    +1 |    +2 | Deck sum |
 | --------  | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :------: |
 | # in deck |   10  |     3 |     1 |     3 |     3 |   -10    |
  
  ###Long game
  
 | Card type |   -1  |    -2 |    -3 |    +1 |    +2 | Deck sum |
 | --------  | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :------: |
 | # in deck |   16  |     4 |     2 |     4 |     3 |   -20    |

 Here is an example of the time card using the standard setup, with the time status token at 0, and the time target token at -10:
 
 ![Time card with time status token placed at 0, and time target token placed at -10](/dragon_pants/images/time_card_small_example.png)

 *Advanced Note: If you're not playing the standard game, you should note that the (negative) sum of the Deck of Destiny must not be greater (ie, less negative) than the time goal. IE, if your time goal is -15, but the Deck of Destiny sums to only -10, it's not guaranteed that the game will end even when all cards have been drawn. But if the Deck of Destiny sums to -16, that's fine.*  

3. Set up the "Deck of Power"

  The rest of the cards are the "Deck of Power." Find the card labeled "The Pants" and remove it from the Deck of Power and set it aside. Shuffle the remaining cards and place the deck face-down next to the Deck of Destiny.

4. Deal initial power cards

  Deal N cards from the Deck of Power face down into a separate stack, where N is one less than the number of players. Add The Pants to this stack, then shuffle the stack and deal 1 power card to each player, face-up.

5. Place pawns in dragon dens

  Each player selects a dragon pawn and places it on their den tile.

  *Note: I usually play this game with 3 or 4 players. The 5-player variant has an obvious gap that might need to be revised. The 6-player variant is geometrically balanced but I haven't play tested much with that many people. 2 players works fine but 3-4 seems to be the sweet spot.*

##Basic Rules

1. Getting Started

 The player who received The Pants during setup goes first. Each player takes turns in order, with player proceeding to the left. All players begin with their power card face-up, and any future cards the player receives will always stay face up -- each player's hand is public information.
 
2. Taking a turn

 A player may take up to two (2) *actions* on a turn. An *action* is defined as either moving their dragon one tile to an adjacent hexagon, drawing a card from the Deck of Power, or playing a card from their hand.
 
 This means a player may do any of the following in a single turn:
 - Move two (2) spaces
 - Move one (1) space and play one (1) card
 - Move one (1) space and draw one (1) card
 - Draw two (2) cards
 - Draw one (1) card and move one (1) space
 - Draw one (1) card and play one (1) card
 - Play two (2) cards
 
3. Drawing cards
 
 A player may *only* use an action to draw from the Deck of Power if they began that action standing on a Power Tile (the gold tiles marked with a star). For example, if a player is merely standing adjacent to a Power Tile, they may not draw two Power cards this turn, as they must spend one action to move to the Power Tile, then another action to draw a card. If, however, a player started their turn standing on a Power Tile, they may use both actions to draw two cards. 
 
 A. Discarding cards

 Various events in the game will cause a player to discard cards; they should be placed face-up into a separate discard pile next to the Deck of Power.
 
 B. Card choice
 
 If there are any cards in the discard pile next to the Deck of Power, a player may use their draw action to draw a single card from *either* the top of the discard pile (face-up) *or* the top of the Deck of Power (face-down). (The player can either get the known item on top of the discards, or a fresh but random item from the shuffled deck -- drawing from the discards is a common way to acquire The Pants!)
 
 C. Hand Limit
 
 Players have a hand limit of 3 cards. If at any moment a player holds 4 cards (whether by drawing a new card or stealing it from another player), that player must immediately discard one of their cards (their choice).
 
 D. Re-shuffling
 
 When a player spends an action to draw a card from the Deck of Power, but there are no cards available, that player takes all the cards in the discard pile, shuffles them, and places them on the board face-down as a replenished Deck of Power. The player then draws their card from the top of the Deck of Power.
 
4. Biting other dragons

 A player may *bite* another player by moving their dragon into the same tile as the other player's dragon. The biting dragon  now occupies that tile, and the bitten dragon moves back to their den tile. Additionally, the biting dragon selects one power card from the bitten dragon's hand and adds it to their own hand.
 
 A dragon that is standing on a Mountain tile may not be bitten -- this also means that as long as it occupies that tile, no other dragon may move there.
 
 5. Playing Power cards
 
  A player may play a Power card as one of their actions by declaring which card they are using and flipping it face down, marking it as "spent." The card will remain "spent" until the end of their *next* turn, at which time the player may flip it face up again.
 
  However, most cards can only be used in certain situations, so a card can only be played if the card-specific conditions are met. See the next section, "Power Cards" for details.

  A. Line of sight
  
  Certain ranged Power cards require you to have "line of sight" with another player. There are two forms of "line of sight" -- flat-line, and diagonal-line. 
  
  Flat-line of sight means you can draw a straight line between yourself and the target dragon, crossing through the flat sides of the hexagon tiles, without any mountains or other dragons in between you:

  Diagonal-line of sight means you can draw a straight line between yourself and the target dragon, crossing through the diagonal corners of the hexagon tiles, without any mountains or other dragons in between you:
  
  ![](/dragon_pants/images/line_of_sight_diagonal.png)
  
  Any mountains in the between you and the target will block line of sight. You will still be able to target a dragon standing *on* a mountain in your line of sight, but not one *behind* it.
