#Dragon Pants

*Alternatively, "Dragon Trousers" in the U.K. and Europe*

Designed by Megan Bednarz and Lars Doucet

##Overview

2-6 players  
Playtime: ~30 minutes  
Suggested age: 10+ maybe?

##Summary

Players take turns moving their dragons across the board, taking advantage of terrain tiles, and drawing and using power cards, all in the hopes of controlling a legendary artifact of ultimate power: a handsomely tailored and comfortably stylish pair of denim work jeans known as *The Pants*. The Pants can only be worn by one dragon at a time, but control is fleeting as it's only a matter of time until another dragon pries The Pants loose from their owner's claws. Time ticks down one card at a time whenever a dragon wearing The Pants ends their turn. The game concludes when the timer runs out, and whichever dragon happens to be wearing The Pants at that moment wins.

##Setup

1. Arrange the hexagonal tiles like this:

  ![Dragon Pants board](/dragon_pants/images/map_small.png)
  
  NOTE: This game was originally prototyped by using hexagonal tiles from other games I had lying around, such as *The Settlers of Catan.* If you have such a game you can just repurposes existing hexagonal tiles to play *Dragon Pants.*

2. Set up the "Deck of Destiny"

  Place all "time" cards (those bearing a number with a + or - sign) into their own deck. This is the "Deck of Destiny." Select a set of time cards to include in this deck (see table below), shuffle them together, and place the deck face-down next to the board. Place all unused time cards back in the game box -- they will not be used.
  
   Place the time card on the table and choose a game length by placing the time status on a number square. (If this is your first time playing, we recommend using the "Standard game" deck with a game length of **10**).
  
  ###Standard game
  
 | Card type |   -1  |    -2 |    -3 |    +1 |    +2 | Deck sum |
 | --------  | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :------: |
 | # in deck |   13  |     1 |     0 |     3 |     1 |   -10    |
 
  ###Volatile game
  
 | Card type |   -1  |    -2 |    -3 |    +1 |    +2 | Deck sum |
 | --------  | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :------: |
 | # in deck |   10  |     3 |     1 |     3 |     3 |   -10    |
  
  ###Long game
  
 | Card type |   -1  |    -2 |    -3 |    +1 |    +2 | Deck sum |
 | --------  | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :------: |
 | # in deck |   16  |     4 |     2 |     4 |     3 |   -20    |

 Here is an example of the time card using the standard setup, with the time status token at 10:
 
 ![Time card with time status token placed at 10](/dragon_pants/images/time_card_small_example.png)

 *Advanced Note: If you're not playing the standard game, you should note that the (negative) sum of the Deck of Destiny must not be a larger absolute number than the game length. IE, if you start the game at time 15, but the Deck of Destiny sums to only -10, it's not guaranteed that the game will end even when all cards have been drawn. But if the Deck of Destiny sums to -16, that's fine.*  

3. Set up the "Deck of Power"

  The rest of the cards are the "Deck of Power." Find the card labeled "The Pants" and remove it from the Deck of Power and set it aside. Shuffle the remaining cards and place the deck face-down next to the Deck of Destiny.

4. Deal initial power cards

  Deal N cards from the Deck of Power face down into a separate stack, where N is one less than the number of players. Add The Pants to this stack, then shuffle the stack and deal 1 power card to each player, face-up.

5. Place pawns in dragon dens

  Each player selects a dragon pawn and places it on their den tile.

  *Note: I usually play this game with 3 or 4 players. The 5-player variant has an obvious gap that might need to be revised. The 6-player variant is geometrically balanced but I haven't play tested much with that many people. 2 players works fine but 3-4 seems to be the sweet spot.*

##Basic Rules

1. Getting Started

 The player who received The Pants during setup goes first. Each player takes turns in order, with player proceeding to the left. All players begin with their power card face-up, and any future cards the player receives will always stay face up -- each player's hand is public information.
 
2. Taking a turn

 A player may take up to two (2) *actions* on a turn. An *action* is defined as either moving their dragon one tile to an adjacent hexagon, drawing a card from the Deck of Power, or playing a card from their hand.
 
 This means a player may do any of the following in a single turn:
 - Move two (2) spaces
 - Move one (1) space and play one (1) card
 - Move one (1) space and draw one (1) card
 - Draw two (2) cards
 - Draw one (1) card and move one (1) space
 - Draw one (1) card and play one (1) card
 - Play two (2) cards
 
3. Moving

 A player may move onto any space on the board, except for a mountain tile with another dragon on it. A player may move onto a tile occupied by another dragon (see "Biting"), a water tile, a land tile, or a power tile. 
 
 A player starts the game on their own Den tile, and may be forced back here at certain times by other player's actions. However, a player may never voluntarily move into a Den tile, and if they start their turn standing on a Den tile, they *must* immediately move out of it as their first action. A player standing on a den tile may not use power cards, and a player wearing The Pants who ends their turn on a Den tile for any reason may not draw a Destiny card.
 
4. Drawing cards
 
 A player may *only* use an action to draw from the Deck of Power if they began that action standing on a Power Tile (the gold tiles marked with a star). For example, if a player is merely standing adjacent to a Power Tile, they may not draw two Power cards this turn, as they must spend one action to move to the Power Tile, then another action to draw a card. If, however, a player started their turn standing on a Power Tile, they may use both actions to draw two cards. 
 
 A. Discarding cards

 Various events in the game will cause a player to discard cards; they should be placed face-up into a separate discard pile next to the Deck of Power.
 
 B. Card choice
 
 If there are any cards in the discard pile next to the Deck of Power, a player may use their draw action to draw a single card from *either* the top of the discard pile (face-up) *or* the top of the Deck of Power (face-down). (The player can either get the known item on top of the discards, or a fresh but random item from the shuffled deck -- drawing from the discards is a common way to acquire The Pants!)
 
 C. Hand Limit
 
 Players have a hand limit of 3 cards. If at any moment a player holds 4 cards (whether by drawing a new card or stealing it from another player), that player must immediately discard one of their cards (their choice).
 
 D. Re-shuffling
 
 When a player spends an action to draw a card from the Deck of Power, but there are no cards available, that player takes all the cards in the discard pile, shuffles them, and places them on the board face-down as a replenished Deck of Power. The player then draws their card from the top of the Deck of Power.
 
5. Biting other dragons

 A player may *bite* another player by moving their dragon into the same tile as the other player's dragon. The biting dragon  now occupies that tile, and the bitten dragon moves back to their den tile. Additionally, the biting dragon selects one power card from the bitten dragon's hand and adds it to their own hand.
 
 A dragon that is standing on a Mountain tile may not be bitten -- this also means that as long as it occupies that tile, no other dragon may move there.
 
 For the purposes of reaction cards, a bite counts as an *attack* and as a *theft*.
 
6. Playing Power cards
 
  A player may play a Power card as one of their actions by declaring which card they are using and flipping it face down, marking it as "spent." The card will remain "spent" until the end of their *next* turn, at which time the player may flip it face up again.
 
  However, most cards can only be used in certain situations, so a card can only be played if the card-specific conditions are met. See the next section, "Power Cards" for details.

  A. Line of sight
  
  Certain ranged Power cards such as Fireball and Shock require you to have "line of sight" with another player. There are two forms of "line of sight" -- flat-line (ex: Fireball), and diagonal-line (ex: Shock). 
  
  Flat-line of sight means you can draw a straight line between yourself and the target dragon, crossing through the flat sides of the hexagon tiles, without any mountains or other dragons in between you:
  
  ![](/dragon_pants/images/line_of_sight_flat.png)
  
  Diagonal-line of sight means you can draw a straight line between yourself and the target dragon, crossing through the diagonal corners of the hexagon tiles, without any mountains or other dragons in between you:
  
  ![](/dragon_pants/images/line_of_sight_diagonal.png)
  
  Any mountains in the between you and the target will block line of sight. You will still be able to target a dragon standing *on* a mountain in your line of sight, but not one *behind* it.
  
  ![](/dragon_pants/images/line_of_sight_checks.png)
  
  Water tiles confer immunity to line-of-sight powers, but do not block line-of-sight powers the way mountains do. (The dragon on that tile is hiding underneath the water and any attack would fly straight over them). Dragons standing on a water tile are still able to use line-of-sight powers themselves, however (they duck their heads above water to attack).
  
  B. Reaction powers
  
  Some cards (Poison, Rubber Ducky) can only be used in reaction to other powers. When a card is used against you that triggers one of your reaction powers, at that moment you *may elect* to immediately use your reaction power in response, but you do not have to. Two conditions must be met: 1) the reaction must be legal (see the card's rules), and 2) the reaction card must not be spent (it must be face-up). A reaction card used in this way remains "spent" until the end of your *next* turn. 
  
  Example 1: Megan is player 1 in a six player game and completes her turn. John, player 2, hits her with a fireball. Megan plays her Shield in response, canceling the fireball's effects, marking the Shield as "spent." The Shield will not be available until players 3-6 have taken their turns, *and* Megan finishes her *next* turn after that. Until then her Shield cannot protect her.
  
  Example 2: Emily is player 4 in a four player game and it is Lars's turn (he's player 3). He hits her with a freeze spell, and she uses her Amulet in response, canceling the freeze, marking the Amulet as "spent." The Amulet will not be available until Emily finishes her *next* turn which is... really soon! Lars ends his turn and now it's Emily's turn. She takes some actions, ends her turn, and flips her Amulet back over, fully charged and ready to go.

7. Wearing The Pants

 Whenever a player currently holding The Pants ends their turn, they draw a card from the Deck of Destiny and reveal it face up in a discard pile next to the Deck of Destiny. They then move the time status token a corresponding number of spaces. Example: Sean begins his turn with the time status token on "0." He ends his turn wearing the pants, and draws a Destiny card. It's "-1", so he moves the time status token to "-1". Next turn, Lars steals the pants and draws a "-2", he moves the time status token to "-3". On the next three turns, nobody steals the pants, so no Destiny card is drawn. Now it's Sean's turn again, he steals the pants back from Lars, and draws a "+1", moving the time status token to "-2".
 
 The game ends when the time status token reaches the time target token. Players can double check by simply summing up all the discarded Destiny cards. If the Deck of Destiny has been properly arranged, the game should be guaranteed to end when all the cards have been drawn, but because of the random ordering the game could always end early, so you never know exactly how much time is left. When the game ends, whichever player is currently wearing the pants is declared the winner.
 
 Remember, Destiny cards are only drawn when a player wearing The Pants ends their turn! It is not possible for the game to end without someone wearing The Pants.
 
 **SPECIAL RULE:** If the player wearing The Pants is currently occupying a Den tile, then they *do not* draw a Destiny card at the end of their turn.

##Power Cards

Cards can only be used on your turn, unless they're reaction cards.

1. Fireball (attack)  
 Use when: you have flat-line of sight on another dragon  
 Effect: the other dragon loses one of their power cards (their choice).
 
2. Shock (attack+curse)  
 Use when: you have diagonal-line of sight on another dragon  
 Effect: the other dragon loses one of their power cards (their choice) *and* gets sent home to their Den tile.
 
3. Poison (Curse)  
 Use when: you are bitten by another dragon, or targeted by the "tongue" card  
 Effect:  
   Nothing bad happens to you, *and*  
   (bitten): the other dragon is sent back to their Den tile instead of you, does not get to take anything from you, and must discard a card (their choice).  
   (tongue'd): the other dragon must discard a card (their choice), and does not get to take anything from you.
   
4. Amulet (Protect Curse)  
 Use when: another dragon uses a curse card on you  
 Effect: nothing happens to you (but the curse card used against you is spent, as is the amulet). If the curse affected more dragons than just you, nothing happens to *you*, but it still affects everybody else.
 
5. Freeze (Curse)  
 Use when: you have flat-line of sight on another dragon  
 Effect: the other dragon skips their *next* turn. If they are wearing The Pants while frozen, they don't draw a Destiny card when their turn is skipped.
 
6. Banish (Curse)  
 Use when: you have flat-line of sight on another dragon (? was it global range ?)  
 Effect: the other dragon is sent home to their den.
 
7. Mirror (Protect attack or curse)  
 Use when: another dragon uses an attack or curse card on you  
 Effect: whatever was about to happen to you happens to them instead (the fireball hits them, the tongue steals from them and gives to you, etc. If it was a global effect that targeted other dragons as well as you, the original effects still affects everyone else, but the dragon that attacked or cursed you gets the effect meant for you and you remain safe).
 
8. Thunderstorm (Curse)  
 Use when: anytime on your turn  
 Effect: all other dragons are sent home to their Den tiles.
 
9. Shield (Protect Attack)  
 Use when: another dragon uses an attack card on you  
 Effect: nothing happens to you (but the attack card used against you is spent, as is the shield). If the attack affected more dragons than just you, nothing happens to *you*, but it still affects everybody else.

10. Teleport (Curse)  
 Use when: anytime on your turn  
 Effect: trade places with another dragon (even if they're on a Den tile).
 
10. Tongue (Theft)  
 Use when: you have flat-line of sight on another dragon  
 Effect: you take one card (your choice) from the other dragon's hand and add it to your own.
 
11. Rubber Ducky (Theft bait)  
 Use when: another dragon tries to steal from you (either a tongue or a bite)  
 Effect: the dragon that tried to steal has no choice but to steal the irresistible Rubber Ducky, regardless of what choice they wanted to make.
 
12. Boost  
 Use when: anytime on your turn  
 Effect: You may take one extra action this turn, and using this card does not cost one action (but the card is still spent). IE, you can spend this card and then take 3 actions this turn.
