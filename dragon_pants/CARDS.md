#Power Cards

Cards can only be used on your turn, unless they're reaction cards.

| --- |

Use when: you have diagonal-line of sight on another dragon

##3. Poison (Curse)

| --- |

Use when: you are bitten by another dragon, or targeted by the "tongue" card  
Effect:  
   Nothing bad happens to you, *and*  
   (bitten): the other dragon is sent back to their Den tile instead of you, does not get to take anything from you, and must discard a card (their choice).  
   (tongue'd): the other dragon must discard a card (their choice), and does not get to take anything from you.
   
##4. Amulet (Protect Curse)  
 Use when: another dragon uses a curse card on you  
 Effect: nothing happens to you (but the curse card used against you is spent, as is the amulet). If the curse affected more dragons than just you, nothing happens to *you*, but it still affects everybody else.
 
##5. Freeze (Curse)  
 Use when: you have flat-line of sight on another dragon  
 Effect: the other dragon skips their *next* turn. If they are wearing The Pants while frozen, they don't draw a Destiny card when their turn is skipped.
 
##6. Banish (Curse)  
 Use when: you have flat-line of sight on another dragon (? was it global range ?)  
 Effect: the other dragon is sent home to their den.
 
##7. Mirror (Protect attack or curse)  
 Use when: another dragon uses an attack or curse card on you  
 Effect: whatever was about to happen to you happens to them instead (the fireball hits them, the tongue steals from them and gives to you, etc. If it was a global effect that targeted other dragons as well as you, the original effects still affects everyone else, but the dragon that attacked or cursed you gets the effect meant for you and you remain safe).
 
##8. Thunderstorm (Curse)  
 Use when: anytime on your turn  
 Effect: all other dragons are sent home to their Den tiles.
 
##9. Shield (Protect Attack)  
 Use when: another dragon uses an attack card on you  
 Effect: nothing happens to you (but the attack card used against you is spent, as is the shield). If the attack affected more dragons than just you, nothing happens to *you*, but it still affects everybody else.

##10. Teleport (Curse)  
 Use when: anytime on your turn  
 Effect: trade places with another dragon (even if they're on a Den tile).
 
##11. Tongue (Theft)  
 Use when: you have flat-line of sight on another dragon  
 Effect: you take one card (your choice) from the other dragon's hand and add it to your own.
 
##12. Rubber Ducky (Theft bait)  
 Use when: another dragon tries to steal from you (either a tongue or a bite)  
 Effect: the dragon that tried to steal has no choice but to steal the irresistible Rubber Ducky, regardless of what choice they wanted to make.
 
##13. Boost  
 Use when: anytime on your turn  
 Effect: You may take one extra action this turn, and using this card does not cost one action (but the card is still spent). IE, you can spend this card and then take 3 actions this turn.
