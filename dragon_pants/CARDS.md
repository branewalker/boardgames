| --- |

Use when: you are bitten by another dragon, or targeted by the "tongue" card  
Effect: nothing happens to you, *and* the other player is sent back to their Den tile instead of you, does not get to take anything from you, and must discard a card (their choice).  
   
##4. Amulet (Reaction Vs. Curse)

| --- |

Use when: another player uses a curse card on you  
Effect: nothing happens to you (but the curse card used against you is spent, as is the amulet). If the curse affected more dragons than just you, nothing happens to *you*, but it still affects everybody else.
 
##5. Freeze (Curse)

Use when: you have flat-line of sight on another player  
Effect: the other player skips their *next* turn. If they are wearing The Pants while frozen, they don't draw a Destiny card when their turn is skipped.

##7. Mirror (Reaction Vs. attack or curse)

Use when: another player uses an attack or curse card on you  
Effect: whatever was about to happen to you happens to them instead (the Fireball hits them, the Tongue steals from them and gives a card to you, etc. If the attack or curse also affected players besides you, the original effect still happens to everyone else, but the player that attacked or cursed you gets hit with the effect that was meant for you.
