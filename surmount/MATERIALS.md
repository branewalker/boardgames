#Materials

You can build this game set yourself out of certain common items, but an "official" Surmount set would look like this:

32 colored blocks
- 8x red blocks
- 8x blue blocks
- 8x yellow blocks
- 8x black blocks
- 1x 3D four-tiered pyramid

You can prototype this with Duplo and/or Lego, though for actually constructing a permanent set it'd probably be cheaper to use other materials.
