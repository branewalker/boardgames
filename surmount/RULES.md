##1. 

##3. Winning the Game

When you control all four of your opponent's inner home spaces, you win the game. "Control" means that you 1) have one of your blocks occupying that space, and 2) you control the stack that block belongs to, if any. If you have a block occupying a goal space, but it belongs to a stack controlled by another player, that doesn't count. If you control a stack occupying a goal space, but the block on the bottom of the stack is not your, that doesn't count.

Counts:

(image of 3-storey stack all of one color on goal space)  
(image of 3-story striped stack with your color on top and bottom on goal space)

Doesn't count:

(image of 2-storey block on goal space with yours on bottom and opponent's on top)
(image of 3-storey block with opponent's on bottom and yours on top)
