#Rules

##1. Moving

On your turn, you may move one block (or one stack) by one space. You may move only in orthogonal directions, diagonal movement is not allowed. You may always move onto an unoccupied space at the same level as your block. You may also move vertically upwards and downwards. If you move a block or stack off of its current level such that there is nothing below it, it will "fall" until the block or stack reaches solid ground. A block or stack may move downwards by several levels in a single move in this way.

##2. Vertical movement

Only single blocks may move upwards vertically. Single blocks may always move up by one level as part of a normal orthogonal move, so long as they are entering an unoccupied space. Single blocks may *not* move upwards by more than one vertical level. Single blocks may also "climb" blocks of the same color the same way they can climb the board itself, but cannot "climb" blocks of another color. Moving upwards in this way requires both blocks to start on the same vertical level. Blocks may, however, always "slide" onto the top surface of other blocks occupying the level immediately below them, regardless of color. 

##3. Stacks

When a block climbs onto a friendly block, or slides onto an opponent's block, it forms a vertical stack of blocks. The player who controls the block on top of the stack controls the entire stack. Any player whose blocks are contained in the stack, but who does not control the top block, may not move any of their pieces contained within it unless they regain control of the stack. The player who controls the stack may move the entire stack as one piece, but may still only move it by one space per turn. Unlike single blocks, stacks cannot climb vertically under any circumstances, though the controlling player may "split" the stack at any level by sliding the top piece and any number of pieces below it off of the stack onto an adjacent space. In some cases this will reveal an opponent's piece on the top of the remaining stack or single block, which will revert control of that remaining stack or block to that opponent.

##4. Winning the Game

When you control all four of your opponent's inner home spaces, you win the game. "Control" means that you 1) have one of your blocks occupying that space, and 2) you control the stack that block belongs to, if any. If you have a block occupying a goal space, but it belongs to a stack controlled by another player, that doesn't count. If you control a stack occupying a goal space, but the block on the bottom of the stack is not your, that doesn't count.

Counts:

(image of single block on goal space)  
(image of 3-storey stack all of one color on goal space)  
(image of 3-story striped stack with your color on top and bottom on goal space)

Doesn't count:

(image of 2-storey block on goal space with yours on bottom and opponent's on top)
(image of 3-storey block with opponent's on bottom and yours on top)
